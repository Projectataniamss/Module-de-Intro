4.Graphics Enhancement tools and related (wxPython, JPython, Tkinter, pyopengl,Kivy, PyQt, gui2Py, libavg)
(Kivy is for cross platform (alternative for this ... PyQt)... works for Android/iOS as well)
(PyGUI is considerably simpler and just for Unix, Macintosh and Windows platforms.)
(Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python)
(wxPython is also good and highly used)
(Moreover using HTML CSS n JS GUIs could also be implemented ....... but only if we had more time to breach the depths of these!!!!)
